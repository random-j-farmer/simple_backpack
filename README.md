Simple Backpack - Minecraft Mod
-------------------------------

From the mod description by the original author:

> One size backpack (54 slot).
> No tiers, no keybind, no dye, no placing in chest slot or on the ground, no Trinket slot.
> Just a "simple" backpack that can be made in early game.

I don't really know what I am doing, I just made it compile for 1.20.1, and it seems to work.

    ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
    # then use the jar from the build directory
